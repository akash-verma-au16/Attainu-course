        USE OF OPERATORS IN PYTHON

        ARITHMETIC OPERATORS     

S.NO  SYNTAX   :    OPERATORS             :    DESCRIPTION
     
1.    a + b    :    Addition " + "        :    This operator is used to add "a" and "b" then, gives the result as output.

2.    a - b    :    Subtraction " - "     :    This operator is used to subtract "b" from "a" then, gives the result as output.

3.    a * b    :    Multiplication " * "  :    This operator is used to multiply "a" and "b" then, gives the result as output.

4.    a / b    :    Division " / "        :    This operator is used to divide "a" from "b" then, gives the result as output.

5.    a // b   :    Integer " // "        :    This operator is used to divide "a" from "b" and gives only the integer part of the quotient as output.

6.    a % b    :    Remainder " % "       :    This operator is used to divide "a" from "b" and thereby gives remainder as the output.


	BOOLEAN OPERATORS

S.NO  SYNTAX   :    OPERATORS             :    DESCRIPTION

1.    a == b   :    Equal                 :    This is an "Boolean equality operator" which checks the values and gives true or false depending on the condition.

                                               Example :   a=5                a=5                                                        
	                                                   b=5                b=6
	                                                   a==b               a==6
                                                           Output --> True    Output --> False

	                                                

2.    a != b   :   Not Equal              :    This is an "Boolean in-equality operator" which checks if the value is not equal to the condition and gives true false as output

	                                       Example :   a=5                a=5                                                        
	                                                   b=5                b=6
	                                                   a!=b               a!=6
                                                           Output --> False    Output --> True
