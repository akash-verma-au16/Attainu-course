A web browser needs two things in order to access a website or a domain which is the IP address
and the Port of the domain but when we write a website address or domain name in a web browser, 
the browser doesn't directly know the IP address or the port of the URL provided so, it has to 
go to an entity known as Domain Name System (DNS) to fetch the IP address and port of the URL. 

DNS has the mapping of the domain names to their respective IP addresses and ports which is 
managed and controlled by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). The IETF is responsible to 
manage the Internet and the DNS servers. So, when the DNS server gives the browser the mapped
IP address and the Port of the domain, the browser then goes to the address and fetches the 
website from that address where the code of the website is stored in a server (computer) of 
a Hosting Service Provider.

These Hosting Service providers like AWS, AZAURE which give act as brokers to the IETF and 
the Domain owners. These Hosting Service providers buy the domain addresses from the IETF and
rent them out to the people looking for a domain. So they provide the server space to the 
people and host their website on their servers from where the website can stay active all the 
time and the code for the website can be accessed by any browser whenever it is searched on it.
