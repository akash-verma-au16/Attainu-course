Tiny URL:
        A free URL shortening service that produces short, memorable alias URLs for
        existing web pages. It enables users to enter a long URL and add a custom parameter
        to create the shortened URL. This URL then redirects to the web page from the
        original URL. The shortened URL never expires, so as long as the destination URL is
        the same, the shortened version will always be functional.

        These URLs are universally unique. These kinds of URLs are most commonly used in
        email campaigns, social media posts, print advertisements, and other marketing efforts
        where an easy-to-remember URL (or one with limited characters) is beneficial for
        driving traffic to a specific page. It’s also helpful for adding UTM parameters to a link
        without making them obvious to the audience.

        In addition to Tiny URL, other examples of URL shortening services include Bit.ly,
        Rebrandly, Owl.ly, Cut.ly, and Shorte.ST. Unlike some of its competitors, Tiny URL
        has always provided all of its features for free. Some social media platforms like
        Twitter and LinkedIn also have inherent URL shortening services, but users must
        create an account to draft a post and access those features.
        
        Software designing is more about “thinking” and “asking questions”. Get specific
        and minimum requirements for the project. When questioned about how to make a
        tiny URL, find out the requirements for the short URL.

        Few things that we should ask them is:

        1. MVP (Minimal Viable Project)
        2. Calculations
        3. High Level Picture

        They basically deal with issues like:
         Portability
         Security
         Maintainability
         Reliability
         Scalability
         Performance
         Reusability
         Flexibility
