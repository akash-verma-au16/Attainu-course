- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):

      The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on 
      Internet Protocol (IP) networks, whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address 
      and other network configuration parameters to each device on the network, so they can 
      communicate with other IP networks.

- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):

      The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering 
      the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated with a given internet layer 
      address, typically an IPv4 address. 
      This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite. 
                         

- Network Address Translation (NAT):

      Network Address Translation (NAT) is an Internet standard that enables a local-area 
      network (LAN) to use one set of IP addresses for internal traffic and a second set 
      of addresses for external traffic. Developed by Cisco, the NAT process relies on a 
      device (usually a router) to make all necessary IP address translations where the 
      LAN meets the Internet.
